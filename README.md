# QT3D
Fun with Qt 5.11 in VS2017

Step1: download Visual Studio and Qt, setup VS for C++ and add the Qt tool from the marketplace
-Completed.

Step2: Start a new solution useing Qt Gui, build and run to make sure you get a blank open window.
-Completed
-added to Github.

Step3: Design a form which can be used for developing parts of a larger program, I will use Buttons around the screen border.
This Gui will enable me to test Qt3D in various ways by changing whats being displayed useing the Buttons.
It ensures that we are useing the same base Qt3D seup for all our development projects.
- In Progress
